# Frontend Developer Take-Home Assignment: Reading List Application

Welcome to our frontend developer hiring process! We're excited to see what you can do. For this take-home assignment, we'd like you to build a reading list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will help us gauge your frontend development skills, including your ability to work with DOM manipulation, event handling, and API integration.

## Instructions:

### Setup:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Create a new branch for your work. Please name the branch something descriptive like `reading-list-yourname`.

### Reading List Requirements:
- Create a web page that displays a list of books.
- Each book should display at least its title, author(s), and a button indicating whether it has been read or not.
- Implement functionality to toggle the read status of each book when its corresponding button is clicked.
- You can hardcode the initial list of books in your code or (better) fetch them from an external API like [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/subjects). 

### Implementation Guidelines:
- Use HTML for the structure of the page.
- Use CSS for styling the reading list and any other elements as you see fit. You can use a CSS framework if you prefer.
- Use Vanilla JavaScript for implementing reading list logic, handling user input, and updating the DOM.
- Ensure the reading list is visually appealing and easy to use.
- Make sure your code is well-structured, readable, and commented where necessary.
- If you choose to fetch data from an API, handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

### Submission:
- Once you've completed the assignment, push your branch to this repository.
- Create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
- In the PR description, provide any instructions necessary for running your reading list application locally (if different from opening an HTML file in a browser).
- Feel free to include any additional comments or explanations about your implementation choices.

### Deadline:
- Please submit your completed assignment within [specify deadline here]. Let us know if you need an extension.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality: Does the reading list display correctly? Can users toggle the read status of books and add new books via the form?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Are best practices followed?
- UI/UX: Is the reading list interface intuitive and visually appealing? Does it provide clear feedback to the user?
- API Integration (if applicable): Are books fetched from the API correctly? Are errors handled gracefully?

We're looking forward to seeing your reading list application! If you have any questions or need clarification on anything, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
